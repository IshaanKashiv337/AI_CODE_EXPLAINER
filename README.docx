This project presents a fully offline, AI-driven tool designed to make learning Python programming easier and to enhance code understanding for beginners.
Leveraging the GPT-Neo 125M model from HuggingFace, it analyzes Python code and generates clear, beginner-friendly explanationsâ€”all without needing internet access.
The application uses Streamlit to offer an interactive user interface and PyTorch for efficient local model execution on CPU-based systems.
With a focus on privacy, it is well-suited for educational environments like classrooms, coding bootcamps, or self-learners seeking real-time code insights.
The tool can interpret a wide range of Python structures, including loops, functions, and conditionals, effectively explaining both simple and moderately complex logic.
Since it runs without any external API calls, it ensures better portability, faster response times, and complete data privacy.
Whether you're a student troubleshooting assignments or an instructor demonstrating code offline, this lightweight solution acts as a smart, educational assistant powered by open-source language models.
